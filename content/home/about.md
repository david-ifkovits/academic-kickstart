I am a PhD candidate at Harvard's [Department of Government](http://gov.harvard.edu), and a data scientist. In my dissertation, I study *political socialization* - the long term impact of formative life events on political behavior. One aim of my research is to identify strategies to reduce the extent of *political polarization* in Western democracies. I use quantitative methods and causal inference to identify the determinants of pro-democracy beliefs, electoral participation, and partisanship.

At Harvard, I am as a resident tutor and academic advisor at [Mather House](https://mather.harvard.edu/), as well as a graduate student affiliate at the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/) and the [Weatherhead Center for International Affairs](https://wcfia.harvard.edu/).

As a data scientist, I have previously worked for a spatial analytics startup in Silicon Valley ([Orbital Insight](https://orbitalinsight.com/)), and international organizations such as the The World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA). I also helped develop the publicly available  [HarvardX](https://harvardx.harvard.edu/) *Data Science Certificate* online course.

I grew up in Austria, where I did my undergraduate studies at Vienna University of Economics and worked as a business journalist. Later, I was fortunate to receive a Fulbright stipend, which allowed me to pursue graduate school in the US.

When I'm not working, chances are you can find me doing one of the following: Exploring the greater Boston area by bike, going on adventures with my dog [Laika](https://www.instagram.com/laikathespacefox/), hanging out with the wonderful residents of Mather, or taste-testing one of the many great coffee shops and restaurants in Cambridge/Somerville with friends.
