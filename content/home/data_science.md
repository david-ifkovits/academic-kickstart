As a quantitatively inclined social scientist, I am excited about the growing
systematic use of data by governments, non-profits and companies.

I am currently most excited about

- normalization methods to reduce biases
- non-probability survey sampling
- big data tools such as Spark
- experimental testing and UX design

Innovations in these methods occur fast, so to stay up to date
I am pursuing a masters degree at Harvard's [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/).
